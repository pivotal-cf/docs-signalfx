<strong>IMPORTANT: </strong>

purposes only. Do not use this product in a PCF production environment.

This documentation describes the SignalFx Monitoring and Alerting integration for Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF). Use this
integration to monitor the health and performance of your Pivotal Cloud Foundry deployment using SignalFx. This
integration retrieves metrics about your Pivotal Cloud Foundry deployment from the Loggregator Firehose and BOSH Health
Monitor, and sends them to SignalFx.  This tile will forward all Firehose metrics, including any custom metrics you
might be sending to the Firehose through Metron.  It also sends the BOSH Health Monitor metrics for all BOSH-managed
VMs.

In addition to this tile, we also offer a [BOSH Release of our agent](https://github.com/signalfx/agent-boshrelease)
that can be mixed into your BOSH deployments in order to collect metrics on services running alongside your CF
deployment.
